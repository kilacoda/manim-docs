Installation
============

There are two ways to install manim. Either using pip or the github repository.

.. note:: 
    One may use Docker as well, but I believe most of us rather wouldn't. If you're interested in using the Docker image, please see the steps in the `repo's README <https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/README.md>`_.


Prerequisites
-------------

Manim requires `cairo`_, `latex`_, `sox`_ and `ffmpeg`_. See how to install each of them `here`_.

.. _cairo: https://www.cairographics.org
.. _latex: https://www.latex-project.org
.. _sox: http://sox.sourceforge.net
.. _ffmpeg: https://www.ffmpeg.org
.. _here: https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/README.md

Method 1: Using pip
-------------------

.. code-block::

    [py|python|python3 -m] pip install manimlib

The PyPI version allows you to call manim using the ``manim`` command but the tradeoff is that it's less frequently updated and thus you won't have new features if added (``Text``,for example).

Method 2: From the GitHub repo
------------------------------

Manim is hosted `here <https://github.com/3b1b/manim>`_. Download or `clone <https://www.wikihow.com/Clone-a-Repository-on-Github>`_ it to wherever you'd like to.
Now run the following command while in the manim folder:

.. code-block::

    [py|python|python3 -m] pip install -r requirements.txt

This'll install all of manim's dependencies.
