Welcome to my version of Manim's documentation!
===============================================

Manim is a free, open-source animation library written and primarily used by
Grant Sanderson (aka `3Blue1Brown <https://youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw>`_).

This website aims to be a documentation-cum-reference guide for
newcomers and experienced animators alike.

These are not the official docs, which can be found at
`<https://eulertour.com/manim/learn>`_

This is **NOT** a quickstart guide/tutorial for Manim.
For that I'd recommend the following:


* `Theorem of Beethoven's tutorial series <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2B6OzTsMUrwo4hA3BBfS7ZR34K361Z8F>`_
* `Todd Zimmermann's tutorial <https://talkingphysics.wordpress.com/2019/01/08/getting-started-animating-with-manim-and-python-3-7/>`_
* `Malhotra5's tutorial <https://github.com/malhotra5/Manim-Tutorial>`_
