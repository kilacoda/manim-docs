Scenes

`The canvases for your videos.`

Here's a quick rundown of how manim processes videos:

1. Check if the provided class derives from ``Scene``
2. Execute the ``digest_config`` function to associate parameters
   for the scene
3. Execute the ``construct`` function and render whatever's in it.


This is the basic structure of a manim scene::
    
    class Scene_Name(scene_type_to_derive_from):
        CONFIG = {
        ## parameters to be set
        }

        def construct(self):
            ## animation code

where ``scene_type_to_derive_from`` is something like
``Scene``, ``GraphScene``, ``ThreeDScene`` or even your own
self created scene class. The point is that we want all the
functionality provided by the ``Scene`` class, and customise
it as per requirement.
